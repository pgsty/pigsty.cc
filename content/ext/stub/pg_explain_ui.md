```bash
SELECT explain_ui($$query$$);
```

There's a blog post on the idea behind this extension: [Writing a Postgres Extension With Pgrx for Visual Query Plans](https://davidgomes.com/writing-postgres-extension-with-pgrx-query-plans/)


### Example

Let's generate pgbench sample tables

```bash
pgbench -is10
```

Then explain the query with:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION explain_ui;
SELECT explain_ui($$SELECT * FROM pgbench_accounts;$$);
```

You'll get an URL for the visual plan:

```
postgres@u22:5432/postgres=# SELECT explain_ui($$SELECT * FROM pgbench_accounts;$$);
                    explain_ui
